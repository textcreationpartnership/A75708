            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THe ſad occaſion of this Sermon, and not any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of its worth, hath moved me to preſume upon this Dedication. I know that you are ſenſible of the ſmart of that providence, which having, not long ſince, removed worthy D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gouge</hi> and M. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> hath alſo taken from us famous M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;</hi> and the rather, becauſe they all were not only mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of, but alſo cordiall friends unto our Provinciall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. And theſe our late loſses, may well minde us of<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> George Walker. M. Herbert Palmer. M Edwards. M John Gere. M. Robrough. M. Love, &amp;c.</note> the death of many more of our brethren, whoſe hearts, heads and hands, went along with us in the ſetting up and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of the Presbyterian Government in our reſpective Congregations, with mutuall aſsiſtance, Claſsicall and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, both for the Ordination of Miniſters, and the more pure administration of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Hereby doubtleſs the <hi>Lords voice crieth to the City,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 6. 9.</note> more particularly unto us the Miniſters thereof: Oh, that his Majeſty would make us <hi>men of wiſedom,</hi> exemplartly <hi>to ſee his Name!</hi> This is the advice of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Hear the rod and who hath appointed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118717:3"/>
            <p>Brethren, I will not undertake to teach you who are able to inſtruct others, what uſe ſhould be made of theſe dolefull diſpenſations. Have we not cauſe to complain, that we did neither thankfully prize, nor fruitfully improve their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall gifts, graces and experiences, as we ſhould and might have done?</p>
            <p>And ſeeing they (though dead) do still ſpeak, by their uſefull Books printed, or their holy Lives remembred, or by both; ſhould not we be conſcientious imitators of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and fidelity, in thoſe wayes of holy truth, diſcipline and worſhip, which were heartily approved by them, even unto their death?</p>
            <p>Moreover, Becauſe ſo many active members of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince are tranſlated, ought not we who ſurvive, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then one anothers hands the rather, unto double induſtry, with undaunted courage, in our whole Ministeriall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be the more affectionately frequent in prayer, that our good God would make up our loſs, by the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant communications of his peculiar grace?</p>
            <p>And although this ſaying may be ſighed out with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>we heretofore had the ſociety and aſſiſtance of the forementioned fellow-helpers,</hi> becauſe now we have them not: yet may it alſo be a matter of incouragement, becauſe our Presbyterian path, hath been trodden without fainting (yea with joy,) by the foot of them, whoſe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance will be as a ſweet perfume unto poſterity. Having ſpoken thus much, give me leave (upon the ſame account,)<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cortwright. M. Hilderſham. M. Dod. M. Gleaver. M. Dorrell. M. John Paget. M. Bradſhaw. M. Ball, &amp;c.</note> to minde you of ſome few good old Nonconformiſts (unto whom many more might be added) who many years ſince (when under Prelaticall power and oppreſsion) endeavoured, by preaching, printing, praying and ſuffering, to introduce this Presbyterian government which we do now exerciſe.
<pb facs="tcp:118717:3"/> Though thoſe men diſliked the uſe of ſuperſtitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet they oppoſed their tenents and practice, who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> condemning it, and the Miniſtry of it as Antichriſtian: But they ſtudiouſly ſought to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, whoſe labours God bleſſed to the converſion of thouſands of ſouls and to the maintaining of the power of godlineſs all their dayes, and whoſe profitable Works do ſtill praiſe them in the gate? But what need I look ſo farre backward, ſeeing we can eaſily remember a great company who formerly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with us here in <hi>London,</hi> in ſetting up and exerciſing<note place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Harris.

            <p>As this bright clowd of ſo many witneſſes (ſome in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ſome on earth) may be relieving unto our mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts under our great loſs; ſo (bleſsed be God) we have not yet cauſe to complain with the Prophet, that <hi>there is no cluſter</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mic. 7. 1, 2.</note>: for though much contempt is caſt upon us (by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who rather ſeek great things for themſelves in the world, then the things of Jeſus Christ) as an inconſiderable number, yet we have (I will ſpeak it to the praiſe of the Lord) threeſcore Presbyterian Miniſters within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of our Province, who preach profitably, and live godly, who are not tainted with the erroneous tenents ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Arminians, Antinomians or Anabaptiſts. And the moſt high will (I humbly hope) incouragingly appear farther for us in theſe pathes, which (as our conſciences be perſwaded) are chalked out in the Scriptures of truth, for the welfare of his Churches, and the honour of his own Name by

            </p>
            <p>I will conclude this my addreſs unto you (my much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured brethren) with this hearty prayer, that you may hold on in this good old way, till you be gray-headed; nothing doubting, but that your heary heads will be a Crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being found in theſe wayes of righteouſneſs.</p>

The Lord make my Sermon as ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as I know my Text to be ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Proverbs</hi> are grave Sentences full of worth and weight, which are the rather to be pondered ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Authours wiſedom and authority; <hi>The Proverbs of Solomon, the Son of David, King of Iſrael;</hi> They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 1.</note> Propoſitions (eſpecially from the beginning of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter) and therefore (for the moſt part) to be conſidered without any context or coherence at all. Every Proverb is like a precious Pearl tending to inrich all them with ſpiritual wiſedom, who ſhall make faithfull improvement thereof through Gods ſpeciall grace.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Proverb (which I have choſen to be the matter of my preſent diſcourſe) I deſire you to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</p>
            <p n="1">1. The diviſion of the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The interpretation of the words.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the divine truth from hence tendred unto our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>The parts of the Text (being an intire Propoſition) are two.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118717:5"/>
            <p n="1">1. The Subject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Predicate.</p>
            <p>The Subject or the matter ſpoken unto is, <hi>The hoary head.</hi> And the Predicate or that which is aſſerted lieth in the words following, <hi>It is a Crown of glory if it be found in a way of righteouſneſſe.</hi> Wherein two things are notable.</p>
            <p>1. The high commendation given of old age, <hi>The hoary head is a Crown of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The limitation which is warily added, <hi>If it be found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus from the Text divided I put forward to the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words herein uſed; And becauſe the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is conditionall, I will firſt open the words in the aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſecondly, thoſe which are in the condition.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the aſſertion two things are inquirable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by <hi>the hoary head?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What is to be underſtood by the <hi>Crown of glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this phraſe <hi>the hoary head</hi> there is a double Metonymy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Metonymy of the effect for the cauſe, <hi>viz. hoary head</hi> put for old age the cauſe thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And a Metonymy of the adjunct for the ſubject, the hoary hairs for the perſon upon whom they are to be found.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a Synecdoche in the expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> one part put for the whole; The head for the whole perſon aged.</p>
            <p>And the language is likewiſe Metaphoricall, for man in his declining age ſeemeth to be compared unto the Winter, the latter part of the year, wherein the ſuperficies of the earth is white, being covered with hoary froſt.

            <p>If enquiry be made, what is meant by the <hi>Crown of glory?</hi> I anſwer, that there is an Hebraiſm in the words, <hi>viz. a Crown

               <hi>with which the ancient Kings did content themſelves, as thinking that a Crown only belonged to their gods.</hi> Let it be noted that it is more then a <hi>garland</hi> which may belong to ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour in one exploit, though in all other regards a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mean and conſiderable.

            <p>Secondly, In the condition annexed, <hi>If found in the way of righteouſneſſe,</hi> there are three things enquirable, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What is ſignified by <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What the word <hi>way</hi> doth ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is hinted in this expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> of being <hi>found in this way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, I will not ſpend time in reporting either the various acceptions or uſes of the word <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> in the holy Scriptures. In this place it noteth a carefull conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto the revealed will of God, all whoſe Commandments are <hi>righteouſneſſe;</hi> In which reſpect <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>This ſhall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 138. Dan. 6. 25.</note> 
               <hi>be our righteouſneſs if we obſerve to do all theſe Commandments.</hi> For in ſo doing we do <hi>ſuum cuique trihuere,</hi> give every one their right, <hi>viz.</hi> God, our ſelves, and our neighbours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive due reſpect by obedience rendred unto laws divine.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118717:6"/>
            <p>Now before I apply Righteouſneſſe in this ſenſe unto the truth in the Text, I muſt neceſſarily diſtinguiſh betwixt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe Legal and Evangelical.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Legall righteouſneſſe conſiſts in a compleat conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto Laws divine in their utmoſt latitude; And thus our<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 29. 1 Joh. 2. 1.</note> firſt Parents were habitually righteous at their firſt creation, and our bleſſed Saviour was actually <hi>Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> But all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity fall ſhort hereof both in their nature and practice. As in the eſtate of unregeneracy the Apoſtle concludeth <hi>all under ſin,</hi> and ſaith both of Jews and Gentiles, <hi>There is none righteous, no not one;</hi> So in the eſtate of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 9, 10.</note> ſo many are the imperfections of them who are moſt compleat on earth, that in the ſenſe aforeſaid they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted righteous. Though <hi>David</hi> is called a <hi>man after Gods own heart,</hi> yet his praier and teſtimony do atteſt<note place="margin">Act. 13. 22. Pſa. 143. 2.</note> this truth, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy Servant, O Lord, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But in a Goſpel ſenſe, according to the indulgence and conſtruction of free rich grace, Gods gracious ſervants are ſaid to be righteous. Thus God himſelf ſpeaketh of <hi>Noah, Thee have I ſeen righteous before me.</hi> And this character the<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 1. Luk. 1. 6.</note> holy Ghoſt giveth of <hi>Zechary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, They were both righteous before God.</hi> And this Evangelicall righteouſneſſe doth conſiſt 1. partly in their ſincere endeavour to reach perfection, in which reſpect they are deſcribed to be ſuch<note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 1.</note> who <hi>follow after righteouſneſſe,</hi> whereupon God accepting the will for the deed doth call them rigbteous. 2. And principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe unto them upon<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21. Phil. 3. 9. Jer. 23. 6.</note> their humble fiduciall cloſures with him by faith unfained, who is the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſſe;</hi> Now of this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the Text to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>The ſe ſecond Quaery was, What doth the word <hi>way</hi> ſuggeſt?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That Gods Servants being as <hi>ſtrangers and ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 39. 12.</note> in this world, and their life being a travelling toward hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 9, 10, 13, 14.</note> their long home, where they look for their everlaſting abode; their holy converſation on earth is ealled their <hi>way,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118717:6"/> which ſuggeſteth both the activity and progreſſe of Gods grace in the fruits thereof. This <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeak unto, very clearly and fully, <hi>The path of the righteous is as</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>the ſhining light which ſhineth more and more unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the third demand, I anſwer, That a perſon may be ſaid to be <hi>found in the way of righteouſneſſe,</hi> when there is conſpicuity and permanency in a godly converſation; when the candle of grace lighted in the heart doth diſcover it ſelf by its ſhining, and is kept burning (according to the advice of Chriſt) <hi>that men may ſee his good works,</hi> as it is ſaid, that<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16. Act. 11. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Paul ſaw the grace of God,</hi> in the Chriſtians at <hi>Antioch;</hi> ſo here when the ſeed of righteouſneſſe rooted in the hearts of aged perſons doth ſo bud and fructifie in their lives that ſuch who converſe with them do or may finde apparent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focts of Gods grace in them, then they are found in the way of righteouſneſſe. I ſhall not beſtow any more words, or time, in the Expoſition of the Text, but proceed according to promiſe, unto the handling of that ſeaſonable Point of Doctrine which is held forth from this Text. <hi>The hoary head is a Crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Old age attended with the power of grace and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>of Religion, is a matter of much honour and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered from the language in the Text how farre this Truth doth extend, <hi>viz.</hi> indefinitely to all aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who be truly pious;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of both Sexes, both men and women.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of all ranks and conditions in the world, whether high or low, rich or poor, whether more nobly deſcended or more mean and contemptible in regard of deſcent, whether on the Throne or at the footſtool.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of all qualities, in regard of naturall or acquired ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, whether corporally beautified, or deformed, whether more or leſſe enriched with the ornaments of the minde, <hi>viz.</hi> learning and other abilities for employment ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or in Common-wealth.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118717:7"/>
            <p n="4">4. Of all callings and negotiations amongſt men, whether ſacred or civil, whether by land or ſea, whether in times of warre or peace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And this truth, in this latitude, hath been, is, and will be appliable unto all aged perſons, found in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in all the ages of the world. This is notable from the Original, for as the propoſition is univerſall in reference to all hoary heads found in the way of righteouſneſſe, ſo there is no verb to limit it unto any term of time, either paſt, preſent, or to come, but the holy Ghoſt aſſerts this truth, in relation to all ages and times of the world: That hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and for the preſent, and for the future, the hoary head in the way of holineſſe, hath been, and now is, and hereafter to the end of the world will be a Crown of glory.</p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed gradually in the proof of the Point, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quo magis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo feſtinat ad finem, tento eſt vere venerabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior,</hi> Clem. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand. Eccl. 12. 5. <hi>Flores camite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii.</hi> Iſa. 9. 15. Gen. 25. 8. Judg. 8. 32. 2 Chro. 29. 28. <hi>Summa eſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectutem illam praeſertim quae piis a Deo dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, honorandam eſſe.</hi> Cartwr. <hi>in Text.</hi> Prov. 12. 26. Acts 21. 16. Luk. 2. 36, 37.</note> to the two branches of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Old age in it ſelf, is a matter of commendation: <hi>The beauty of old men is the gray head:</hi> In which reſpect (as ſome Expoſitors judg) the hoary head is compared by <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the <hi>Almond tree flouriſhing,</hi> when the white bloſſoms do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it very beautifull. And hence alſo it is, that according to the Heraldry obſerved in the holy Scripture, <hi>the Ancient and the Honourable</hi> are both placed together, and many of Gods Worthies there recorded, have this character of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour put upon them, that they <hi>died in a good old age and full of dayes</hi> (viz.) <hi>Abraham, Gideon, David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The addition of holineſſe unto the hoary head, addeth much unto the glory of the aged perſon: and this the holy Ghoſt doth chiefly intend in the Text. For the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>eatenus,</hi> becauſe righteous, <hi>is more excellent then his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> And therefore under this Notion, many are regiſtred in holy writ to their everlaſting credit in the Church of Chriſt, (<hi>viz.) Mnaſon of Cyprus that old Diſciple;</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, a Propheteſſe of a great age, a widow of about fourſcore and four years, who departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God, with faſtings and prayers night and day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that righteouſneſſe giveth weight unto the Crown
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118717:7"/> which aged perſons do wear, may be abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is one part of <hi>Gods image in man,</hi> with which<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 29. Rom. 3. 20. Eph. 4. 24.</note> he was adorned at his firſt creation, which was <hi>his glory,</hi> loſt by his fall, and which is <hi>reſtored</hi> by his Regeneration. <hi>The new man, after God, is created in righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe aged perſons, thus qualified, are the Emblems of God himſelf, who is called <hi>the ancient of dayes;</hi> and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus<note place="margin">Dan 7. 9, 13.</note> Chriſt, in whoſe metaphoricall deſcription, this is one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; <hi>His head and his hairs were white like wool.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the righteous are admitted into near relation and affection with God who <hi>is their Father, and loveth them</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 43. Pſal. 146. 8.</note> 
               <hi>dearly. The Lord loveth the righteous. The righteous ſhall ſhine in the Kingdom of their Father.</hi> Now it was <hi>Davids</hi> honour (as he valued it) to be <hi>Son in law to King Saul:</hi> And who<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 23.</note> doth not judge, that it was much to the repute of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to be called <hi>A man beloved by the Lord. Since thou becameſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 21. Iſa. 43. 4.</note> 
               <hi>mine</hi> (ſaith God himſelf to his people) <hi>and waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe three heads of Arguments jointly conſidered, the truth under hand, may be undeniably concluded. <hi>That the hoary head is a Crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Application followeth, which I will give, in manifold Uſes, under four heads.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of Uſes are for Information in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Information.</note> well worthy our conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence it followeth, that no qualification whatſoever, wherewith the children of men can poſſibly be adorned, is of ſo great worth as godlineſſe; becauſe this is ſaid to ſet a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Crown upon the heads of them who are bleſſed with it. I grant that there are many natural ornaments and acquired accompliſhments, which may gain reſpect, but it is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which wins the Crown. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith not, The hoary head is a Crown of glory, if found in the way of raiſed parts, of great learning, of martiall courage, of large commands in the world, or of ſucceſſefull trading to become
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118717:8"/> wealthy, but if it be found in the way of righteouſneſſe. Though people who are under no higher principles then ſenſe and humane reaſon are of another opinion: <hi>They bleſſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 10. 3. Mal. 3. 15. Pſal. 49. 6. with 18.</note> 
               <hi>the covetous whom God abhorreth,</hi> and <hi>they do call the proud hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſet up,</hi> when others are abaſed; becauſe <hi>delivered</hi> when others are in diſtreſſe: yea though many boaſting themſelves in the multitude of their riches, do bleſſe their own ſouls; yet both God and all thoſe whoſe judgements are guided by his word, are of another minde. My text tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you the thoughts of wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> and if you will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto his father <hi>David,</hi> you ſhall underſtand, that his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions were not different. The <hi>Saints</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the excellent in whom is all my delight.</hi> Whence it is notable, that the<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 2.</note> Pſalmiſt there doth not only expreſs his judgment perſonally, but he typically reports the ſenſe of Chriſt, to give to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that himſelf a man according to Gods heart, yea and Chriſt Jeſus infinitely above himſelf, give this eſtimate of holy perſons, that they are incomparably excellent. And if this be not ſufficient to clear the truth of my inference, conſider his confident aſſertion to <hi>Saul</hi> his Courtiers, who prided themſelves in their Courtſhip, and deſpiſed him as a man rejected. <hi>Know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 3. Exod. 19. 5. with ca. 33. 16.</note> 
               <hi>godly for himſelf:</hi> whereas all other perſons whatſoever are looked upon by the Lord as lumber, theſe are <hi>his peculiar treaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond corollary is this: If righteouſneſſe be a Crown, though it be attained in old age only, then how much more honourable are they, who have been found in the way of righteouſneſſe all their life long; from their youth, till their heads are gray. This great commendation, did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<note place="margin">Pſal. 71. 18, 18</note> unto <hi>David.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118717:8"/> green and flouriſhing in the winter of their age; This might be many waies illuſtrated, 1. They have ſerved the Lord ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Apprentiſhips; It is an honour <hi>to ſtand</hi> (to have a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abode as ſervants) <hi>before Kings:</hi> Thus the Queen of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 22. 29.</note> expreſſeth her ſelf in reference unto them who alwaies waited upon King <hi>Solomon, Happy are thy men, and happy are</hi>

               <hi>theſe thy Servants who ſtand continually before thee.</hi> Now this, and greater then this, is the renown of them who have been for many years not only retainers but dwelling-ſervants with the Almighty. 2. They have often been in the field with Chriſt their Captain, they have fought many battels, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many wounds under his Colours and command: The holy Ghoſt hath ſeen cauſe to record in holy Pages ſome of <hi>Davids Worthies</hi> who had made many brave adventures, and<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.</note> done famous exploits in years paſt and gone. And what more ordinary then for Souldiers to ſet forth their own commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, by relating how many years attending on the Army, with hazards run and wounds received; Now the old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers<note place="margin">Enumerat milec vulnera.</note> of Jeſus Chriſt are much more worthy high reſpect, having been found all along in the waies of righteouſneſſe; Such a ſtandard-bearer was <hi>Samuel</hi> who received preſs-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.</note> from God while he was a childe, and could when gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed ſo pleade his righteouſneſſe that it will be alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to his credit and reputation. <hi>I am old and gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,</hi>

            <p>The Third Conſequence or Uſe of Information is this, That it is a very advantagious ſervice to be inſtrumental in promoting the work of Goſpel-righteouſneſſe in the hearts and waies of men, becauſe by means hereof they receive no leſſe then a Crown of glory.

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> propounds the practice of ſuch who <hi>run a race to obtain a corruptible Crown,</hi> as an argument to preſſe the like duty. And Scripture-Hiſtories together with the Stories of all ages do record the ſtrange adventures, yea, attempts both ungodly and unnaturall to advance unto a Crown: Should not we therefore in the way of God ſeek this Crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Now that my advice may be the more prevalent, let theſe conſiderations be well weighed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the greateſt age attainable on earth without righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe will not procure this Crown; Antiquity without piety doth yeeld no more credit then the devil is capable of, who is often called <hi>the Old Serpent,</hi> having had many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years continuance in the world: But when holineſſe is annexed to the hoary hairs, they honour the head with a Crown. How ambitious are proud men (like <hi>Saul</hi>) to be <hi>honoured amongst the people.</hi> Therefore as the laborious Bee ſucketh honey out of weeds, let us graciouſly improve ſuch like examples, to provoke our ſelves to ſeek the honor which cometh in by righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This righteouſneſſe which is attended with a Crown of glory upon earth will undoubtedly bring that which is very much better in heaven. Hearken what our Saviour promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>The righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 43.</note> 
               <hi>of their Father.</hi> And obſerve the expectation of <hi>David</hi> upon this account, <hi>As for me I will behold thy face in righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 17. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſſe.</hi> Though I may not ſpend words in illuſtrating theſe paſſages, yet I wiſh
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118717:14"/> that the aged would ſeriouſly conſider how much is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this glorification and this ſatisfaction aſſured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the righteous at the generall reſurrection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Who doth not (upon ſuch grounds as have been hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) deſire to <hi>die the death of the righteous,</hi> as that wretch<note place="margin">Num. 23. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Balaam</hi> did? therefore wiſedom would work endeavours to attain righteouſneſſe in the time of life. I remember a paſſage in the promiſe made by the Angel concerning the ſucceſſe of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> his Miniſtry, <hi>He ſhall turn the diſobedient</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to the wiſedom of the Juſt;</hi> There is ſingular wiſedom amongſt the righteous; as in other regards, ſo herein, becauſe as they intend the beſt good as their end, ſo they ſeek to accompliſh it, not only by wiſhings and wouldings, but by the reall uſe of the means ſanctified for the obtaining thereof. Let us therefore herein make, imitation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The unrighteous ſhall not finde any favour with God, becauſe of their gray heads when he cometh to judgement. Somewhat was before ſuggeſted to this purpoſe, therefore now I will onely mention two Scriptures, which may be awakening to aged perſons ſleeping in ſecurity. <hi>Though a</hi>

            <p n="5">5. You aged ones are the greateſt monuments of divine patience, which ſhould <hi>leade you unto repentance;</hi> and the Apoſtle giveth in two conſiderations, to adde ſtrength unto this argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe otherwiſe your hearts will be more and more obdurate, and your ſelves become leſſe and leſſe able to reform.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe through your abuſe of Gods forbearance his

               <hi>and forbearance, and long-ſuffering? not knowing that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance; But after thy hardneſſe and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of</hi>

            <p>Secondly, I ſhall bend my advice to the aged who are through Gods grace really righteous. Theſe perſons are to be perſwaded unto reall gratitude to the Lord, who hath ſet a Crown of glory upon their gray-heads. The Pſalmiſt cals<note place="margin">Pſa. 148. 12, 13 <hi>Senes ad grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum actionem excitare.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, You may be moved to praiſe God for your old age by theſe Meditations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe his Highneſſe is the maintainer of our lives, and the lengthener of our daies. Notwithſtanding the means<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 20.

This I might enlarge, by manifeſting the advantages of old mens experiences, both in reference unto their own comfort, and the ſervice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: The holy Pſalmiſt relieveth his drooping ſpirit, in an eſtate of deſertion, by improving of Gods ancient admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. <hi>I have conſidered the dayes of old, the years of ancient</hi>

            <p>Theſe conſiderations may quicken the godly aged to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for their hory heads: but I muſt add, that they have much more cauſe to magnifie God, for making them godly, becauſe old age may be the guift of common bounty, whereas righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is the product of peculiar grace. <hi>The wicked may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>

            <p n="2">2. That the greateſt part of mankinde doth abide in the waies of unrighteouſneſſe; The <hi>whole world</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 19. Gen. 18. 32.</note>

            <p n="3">3. Can you remember either your own many, ſtrong, and long-continued reſiſtances made againſt divine aſſaults, or the manifold Providences and Ordinances, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <p>If by theſe many Arguments the hearts of any aged ones, being reſolved upon gratitude, ſhall enquire how they may in realities expreſſe their thankfulneſſe unto the Lord, both
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118717:16"/> for his long-ſufferance and loving-kindeneſſe towards them. My anſwer is this, That you ſhall be regularly and acceptably thankfull unto God both for your gray-hairs and your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by ſtudying and endeavouring ſuch a frame of heart and courſe of life as may anſwer that counſell which himſelf hath left on record for your guidance in the holy Scriptures which I ſhall plainly and faithfully impart unto you. But before I mention particulars to direct your behaviour, I ſhall premiſe theſe two things to move attention with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to practiſe them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That howſoever, too often, men themſelves do not obſerve when <hi>gray hairs are here and there upon them,</hi> and<note place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 9.</note> many times the aged may ſeem youthfull unto others; yet God doth take exact and particular notice of every aged perſon in the world. The holy Ghoſt recordeth when <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua waxed old, and was stricken in age,</hi> and about what time<note place="margin">Joſh. 23. 1. 1 Sam. 17. 12. Gen. 17. Luk. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Jeſſe</hi> (the Father of <hi>David) went for an old man</hi> in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The like I might diſcover in regard of <hi>Abraham, Sarah, Anna,</hi> But I forbear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lord doth punctually obſerve all the good,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 24. 1 Chro. 23 1. 1 Kin. 13. 11. Gen. 19. 4. Eze. 23. 43.</note> and all the evils of them who are ſtricken in years, whether they be his own people or others. This I enlarge not by ſpecifying inſtances, becauſe the naked quotations may be ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly premiſed theſe things, I proceed to the directions which I finde regiſtred in the Word of God, that the aged may know how to order their converſation in ſome meaſure of anſwerableneſſe unto that Crown of glory which the Lord by his grace and their gray hairs hath put upon them.</p>
            <p>In generall, They muſt be of <hi>ſuch behaviour as becometh</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>holineſſe,</hi> whether they be aged men or women, therefore they ought to advance and expreſſe the power of Gods grace by a diligent improvement of all ſuch means as God hath ſanctified. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> writeth to the <hi>Fathers who were knowing men,</hi> that they might become more holy.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 13, 14 Luk. 2. 37.</note> And old <hi>Anna,</hi> though truly good, yet <hi>waited daily at the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118717:17"/> Temple,</hi> that ſhe might grow better. This I might perſwade by many Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no one who hath lived the longeſt and hath<note place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Taylor</hi> on Tit. 2. 2.</note> made the beſt proficiency in Chriſts School, that is come to that pillar on which he may write, <hi>Ne plus ultra;</hi> But when he hath ſummed up all his rich endowments, ſhall finde cauſe to conclude with the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Not as</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>though I were already perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The grievances of old age are ſuch, and ſo many, as will call for the exerciſe of the ſtrongeſt graces attainable in this life. <hi>Solomon</hi> reckoneth up ſome of them, and telleth the aged perſon, that they will <hi>take away the pleaſures of his</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 2. 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>life;</hi> Then all the faith, patience, and other graces which have been gained will be found weak enough, to wield, the burthens of that eſtate: This, this was the only ſupport of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>when ſtrength and heart did fail, that God was the ſtrength of his heart, and his portion</hi> (to live upon) <hi>for ever.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 73. 26.</note> In this reſpect pains ſhould be taken, that <hi>as the outward man decayeth, the inward man may be renewed daily.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The aged will lie open unto deriſion and diſreſpect in regard of the imperfections and weakneſſes which attend that condition of life, therefore they ſhould labour by eminency of holineſſe to ſecure their credit amongſt all ſorts of people whatſoever; For nothing doth more awe the hearts of the children of men then the power of godlineſſe appearing in the converſations of Gods Servants; As <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed young <hi>Timothy</hi> hereby to prevent contempt, <hi>Let no man deſpiſe thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>but be an example of the beleevers in word and converſation,</hi> &amp;c. So by means hereof <hi>Job</hi> had won great eſtimation amongſt all ſorts; <hi>The young men ſaw me and hid themſelves, and the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 29. 8.</note> 
               <hi>aged aroſe and ſtood up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The miſcarriages of old people are in Gods account the more hainous, becauſe they have had moſt frequent and moſt ancient experiences of his goodneſſe. By this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance the evils of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are once and again aggravated. <hi>God carried them all the daies of old, but they rebelled and vexed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>his holy Spirit: Know that it is an evil thing</hi> (more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118717:17"/> evil) <hi>that my fear is not in thee, for of old time I have</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>broken thy yoke,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And I might adde that their wickedneſſe will do much<note place="margin">Perſenem vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum religio ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta deſtruitur. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note> more miſchief tending more to the diſhonour of God and the infection of others. In all theſe regards it nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth them whom God hath crowned with age and the profeſſion of his Name, to heed their converſation, that it may be ſuitable unto that dignity which the Lord hath put upon them. It may well become every one of them upon this account, frequently and affectionately to make <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Now I am old and gray-headed, O Lord forſake me not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 71. 18.</note> 
               <hi>until I have ſhewed thy ſtrength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</hi> This in general, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The aged ſhould be full of knowledge as they are full of years; This is taken for granted in many Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſages, <hi>With the ancient is wiſedom, and in length of daies is</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 12. 12. Iſa. 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>underſtanding;</hi> And thence it is that the <hi>ancient and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> are conjoyned. Ignorance is much more excuſable in the young, who may thus pleade, <hi>We are but of yesterday,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and know nothing, becauſe our daies upon earth are a ſhadow;</hi> but an old <hi>Ignoramus</hi> is a thing intolerable: <hi>Better is a poor and wiſe childe, then an old and fooliſh King.</hi> When God hath<note place="margin">Eccl. 4. 13.</note> ſet a Crown upon a mans head, and he knoweth not how to wear it; <hi>Honour</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is unſeemly for a fool:</hi> And<note place="margin">Prov. 26. 1.</note> this diſgrace is the greater when means of knowledge are enjoyed, yea, enjoyed for many years. <hi>You</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to ſome who were members of the Church at <hi>Corinth) have not the knowledge of God. I ſpeak this to your ſhame.</hi> And<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 34.</note> in like manner he greatens this defect in others; <hi>When for the time ye ought to be teachers of others, ye have need that one teach</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>you again which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God:</hi> Remember how ſharply Chriſt reproveth <hi>Nicodemus, Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> It would<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 10.</note> be accounted a great diſparagement unto a young man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſerved out an Apprentiſhip, to be unacquainted with the myſteries of his Trade; Now fifty years is above ſeven
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118717:18"/> years in Sabbath-daies, and yet how many of that age (who have had an addition of many weekly Lecture-daies) are yet palpably ignorant in the myſteries of ſalvation? Theſe things I ſuggeſt to ſhame the aged unto endeavours to become rich in underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſhould not only be knowing but fruitful, <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the palm-tree, they ſhall bring</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 92. 12, 14.</note> 
               <hi>forth fruit in old age, they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</hi> This may upon good ground be looked for, from them who are truly good, for though the natural radical heat doth abate in old perſons, yet the ſpirituall vigour which they receive from Chriſt decaieth not. <hi>His branches ſhall ſpread and his</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 6, 8.</note> 
               <hi>beauty ſhall be as the Olive-tree, for from me is thy fruit found.</hi> Although age taketh them off from ſundry emploiments, yet they ſhould be doing ſomething according to their abilities. The holy Ghoſt telleth us <hi>of an old man who came from his work out of the field at even;</hi> In the evening of our age, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">Judg. 19. 16.</note> Sun-ſetting, we ſhould be found acting in one kinde or other for God; and <hi>happy is that Servant whom his Lord</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 43.</note> 
               <hi>when he cometh ſhall finde ſo doing.</hi> Here I will inſtance in three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The aged muſt be <hi>Teachers of good things, Daies ſhould ſpeak, and the multitude of years ſhould teach wiſedome;</hi> This<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 3, 4. Job 3. 2. 7. Gen, 49. Deut. 32. Joſh. 23. 1. Iob 29. 15. Mat. 12. 35. &amp; 13. 52. 1 Tim. 4. 7.</note> was the practice of old <hi>Jacob, Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Job</hi> reporteth this as a ground of his comfort, <hi>I was eyes to the blinde, unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept ſilence at my counſell.</hi> You muſt bring forth of your treaſure <hi>good things, both new and old,</hi> and not trifle out the latter part of your daies <hi>in telling old wives Fables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt communicate their experiences, <hi>Hear this, ye old men, Hath this been in your daies? Tell ye your children</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioel. 1. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.</hi> This hath been the cuſtome of Gods<note place="margin">Pſa. 78. 1. Pſa. 66. 16, 20. Num. 33. 1, 2.</note> Worthies in all ages, according to his command, whereby themſelves have received comfort, others benefit, and God glory. And this I ſeriouſly perſwade, though I have not leaſure to enlarge it. Let future ages underſtand the moſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118717:18"/> remarkable paſſages of Gods Providence which you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, whereby ſin may be rendred odious, and Chriſt with the waies of faith and holineſſe may be repreſented precious to the ſouls of ſucceeding ages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſhould endeavour to clear both their own credit and conſciences, in reference unto all their converſings in the world. This I propound from the example of <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he was <hi>old and gray-headed,</hi> pointing only at the Story,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> which is well worth conſideration and imitation. And in this practice let the honour of Religion be rather vindicated then your own. Give God the glory of your own unreprovable converſation, and for your known miſcarriages expreſſe your repentance, which will produce both preſent inward peace and future reputation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The aged ſhould <hi>poſſeſſe their ſouls with patience,</hi> This is one of the particulars which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth <hi>Titus</hi> to preſſe upon old men, <hi>viz.</hi> that they be <hi>ſound in patience.</hi> This<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 2.</note> grace of patience conſidered under a threefold notion, is needfull, and would be commendable in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Patience in waiting for the full accompliſhment of all Gods Promiſes. <hi>You have need of Patience</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 35.</note> 
               <hi>that after ye have done the will of God, you might receive the promiſe.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>James</hi> propounds the practice of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman to perſwade this; <hi>Behold, the Husbandman waiteth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it.</hi> I may tell you whoſe heads are gray, whoſe lives have been a long ſeed-time in waies of well-doing, <hi>Behold, the fields are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 35.</note> 
               <hi>white already to harveſt;</hi> Your time of reaping is at hand, therefore hold up your heads and hopes in a patient expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your recompence of reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Patience in forbearing thoſe who load you with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. In this caſe let <hi>David</hi> be your Example, who ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 10.</note> without yeelding unto motions made for revenge, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto that affliction with which God did exerciſe him, through the curſings of <hi>Shimei.</hi> With how much contempt doth the Lion (the King of Beaſts) paſſe on his way, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the barkings of angry dogs? Therefore you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118717:19"/> aged ones who are crowned both with gray-hairs and graces, Look upon your ſelves as ready to ſet foot into your palace, and to take poſſeſſion of the Kingdom prepared for you; and hereupon with a holy ſcorn ſlieght all the clamors and ſnarlings of them, who <hi>ſpeak evil of you</hi> becauſe you refuſe<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 1, 4.</note> 
               <hi>to run with them into the ſame exceſſe of riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Eſpecially Patience in a calm and chearful bearing of all thoſe infirmities and afflictions which are wont to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old age. Remember that your age is your Crown, and therefore carry it with contentment, though it cauſe your heads to ake. M. <hi>Cartwright</hi> upon my Text hath this note,<note place="margin">Adverſus ſene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctutis incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moda, &amp; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultates, recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are debet.</note> That the holy Ghoſt doth purpoſely tell the aged, that the hoary head is a Crown, that by this conſideration he might releeve them under all the grievances which attend that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life. M. <hi>Muffet</hi> upon my Text ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Old age is born up by theſe two ſtaves, 1. Life well-ſpent, 2. Hope of future glory.</hi> And Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> hath this expreſſion in his <hi>Meditations and Vows: I account old age the beſt age, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inconveniences of it are only bodily, with a better eſtate of minde. 2. Becauſe nearer to diſſolution.</hi> Hereunto he addeth this Story, <hi>When a man told a Philoſopher, that he was ſorry to ſee him ſo old: he returned this anſwer, Be ſorry rather that ever I was young to be a fool:</hi> Many ſuch like Meditations might be added to check frowardneſſe, to maintain patience under all the preſſures of old age, but I ſhall referre to the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned priviledges which appertain unto them <hi>whoſe hoary heads are found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, They ſhould be <hi>ſound in faith;</hi> 1. Both in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 2.</note> of faith, in the truth of the Scripture, having had long time for triall, to diſcern betwixt things which differ, and therefore in reference to Fundamentals at leaſt they ſhould be able to ſay with <hi>David</hi> to God, <hi>Concerning theſe thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 152. Rom. 4. 19. Luk. 2. 25. Deut. 34. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I have known of old that thou haſt founded them for ever.</hi> 2. And in the grace of faith, being ſtrong in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby they ſhall with old <hi>Abraham</hi> glorifie God, and with old <hi>Simeon</hi> go <hi>ſinging</hi> to heaven; It was an eaſie thing with <hi>Moſes</hi> to die when God had ſhewed him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118717:19"/> Land: And it's a good ſight to behold ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians carried out of this world with full ſail of aſſurance, hearing them to ſpeak, as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>I know that my Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 19. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>and though after my skin worms deſtroy my fleſh, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. It well becometh them likewiſe in times of trouble to pleade their old experiences with bold confidence, <hi>Why withdraweſt thou</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 74. 11, 12. &amp; 71. 17, 19, 21</note> 
               <hi>thine hand, even thy right hand, pluck it out of thy hoſome, for God is my King of old.</hi> Whereas their infidelity is the more inexcuſable in it ſelf, and the more provoking unto God, becauſe manifold providences both in former and later years, have evidenced unto them Gods power and truth; <hi>They</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 106. 21, 22 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>forgat God their Saviour which had done great things in Egypt, wondrous things in the Land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea, therefore he ſaid that he would deſtroy them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they beleeved not his Word.</hi> And hence it was that both <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 20. 12. Luk. 1. 18.</note> and old <hi>Zechary</hi> were ſo ſeverely dealt with for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They ſhould be <hi>ſound in charity,</hi> This the Apnſtle<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 2.</note> addeth to the former. And it is very reaſonable in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards; for as they have long lived upon Gods love, ſo they have received moſt kindeneſſes from men in manifold exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the neceſſities of their old age do call for continued and renewed compaſſion from time to time. Here I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch upon three Rules to guide this grace in its exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For purity, their love ſhould be moſt enlarged upon the account of piety. As it was the praiſe of <hi>Titus, that his</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 15.</note> 
               <hi>inward affection was more abundant whileſt he remembred the obedience of the Corinthians;</hi> When ſpeciall kindeneſſe is ſhewed towards them <hi>who are of the houſhold of faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For perpetuity, they muſt not be <hi>weary of works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 9. <hi>Charitas quae defini potest nunquam vera fuit.</hi> Aug.</note> And doubtleſſe if love be true it will be conſtant, for a friend loveth at all times.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For quantity, it ſhould be encreaſed, and it will be to their high commendation if their works of mercy (as of other kindes) <hi>be more at the laſt then at the firſt.</hi> And therefore<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 19.</note> covetouſneſs ſhould be caſhiered, as the cut-throat of charity.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:118717:20"/>
            <p>Moreover, I might perſwade from the authority of Saint <hi>Paul, ſobriety, temperance, and gravity.</hi> For temperance let<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 2. 2 Sam. 19. 35.</note> old <hi>Barzillai</hi> be an example unto the aged, whoſe modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in reference to the dainties of a Court tendred unto him, was very great. And let the ſad conſequences of <hi>Noah</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 21. <hi>Alto aetas alios mores poſtulat.</hi>
               </note> his intemperance give caution for ſobriety unto all ancient perſons whatſoever. As for gravity, it's a vertue oppoſed to lightneſſe and apiſhneſſe; It ſhould be expreſſed in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſpeech, and apparell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe things I muſt not enlarge. And I will only name what the Apoſtle addeth in relation to old women. They muſt not be <hi>falſe accuſers;</hi> His word ſuggeſts that falſe accuſers are <hi>devil-like,</hi> having<note place="margin">

               <hi>tongues ſet on fire by hell.</hi> This may be a ſufficient watchword to warn them to keep at a diſtance from ſuch exorbitances; The laſt thing which I will adviſe all ancient perſons unto, is conſtancy and perſeverance in waies of righteouſneſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the former directions; I would propound the reſolution of <hi>David</hi> when old and gray-headed for your imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>I will hope continually, and will yet praiſe thee more and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 71. 9. - 14.</note> 
               <hi>more,</hi> &amp;c. You ſhould be unmoveable like unto old Oaks, deeply rooted, which are not turned hither and thither, this way and that way, by every contrary winde. Remember the ſpeech of old <hi>Polycarpus</hi> when tempted to Apoſtaſie, God hath been my good Maſter for 85 years, therefore I will not forſake him: As Arguments to move endeavours after ſteddineſſe both in the profeſſion and practice of the truth, take theſe ſhort particulars into your ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the winter of your age, you may probably be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with violent ſtorms. <hi>When thou ſhalt be old</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter) another ſhall gird thee and carry thee whither</hi>

            <p>Now that my perſwaſion may be the more prevalent with young ones, I ſhall commend theſe following particulars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods expreſſe command: <hi>Remember now thy Creator</hi>

Chriſt is ſaid to love the moral young man; and it is conjectured, that <hi>John</hi> had the more tender reſpect, becauſe he came unto Chriſt ſo ſoon. The gracious ſeaſonings in youth, will alſo make the converſation more ſavoury afterwards: And the ſooner you undertake Gods ſervice, the more glory you ſhall bring unto his Name, the larger recompence likewiſe your ſelves ſhall receive. Finally, this will be an encouragement, unto your hopefull addreſſes unto the Lord, as need may require.

How will you bewail your folly and great ingratitude unto<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 8, 13, 14</note> God, that the devil hath been gratified by your firſt-fruits, and that only the refuſe, dregs, and withered ſtuff of old age, is reſerved for God. And if the Lord ſhould puniſh your obſtinacy in youth, with finall impenitence, how ſad would your reckoning be at the laſt day? for this is moſt certain, that when you have ſowed your wild oats, and ſatisfied the ſinfull deſires of youth, <hi>for all theſe things God will bring you</hi>

               <hi>to judgement.</hi> The Lord give young ones to dwell upon theſe meditations, and to lay them ſeriouſly unto their hearts.

But, alas, alas, poor fooliſh creatures, how careleſſe in ſeeking to keep theſe ſpiritual ſparks alive in their

Fain they would ſave their ſouls, and yet ſatisfie their ſinfull luſts alſo. And thus they fluctuate as a wave upon the ſea, carried hither and thither by contrary windes. Whereas they ſhould upon a ſerious conſideration (whether it be better to ſerve God or the devil, to ſave the ſoul, or to hazard the loſſe of it unto eternity) work themſelves unto an unmoveable deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, to ſeek <hi>the Crown of glory in the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, To yeeld due, reverent reſpect unto aged perſons, eſpecially to ſuch in whom the power of grace doth moſt eminently appear. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cartwright</hi> upon my Text preſſeth this duty, arguing from our honouring them whom men Crown, unto ſuch to whom God aſſigneth the <hi>Crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> As there ſhould be teſtifications of high reſpect unto all ſuch, ſo eſpecially 1.

            </p>
            <p>Now this honourable reſpect of the aged (eſpecially if godly) muſt be expreſſed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By reverent geſtures: <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary</hi>

               <hi>head, and honour the face of the old man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By giving them the precedencie, in ſpeaking in all caſes to be debated. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am young and ye are very old,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By teſtimonies of due eſtimation to their perſons, even at thoſe times when there may be occaſion to blame ſome of their practices. <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but intreat him as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By ſubmitting unto their grave and gracious counſels. <hi>Likewiſe ye younger, ſubmit your ſelves unto the elder.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 5. Philem. 9.</note> ſtileth himſelf <hi>Paul the aged,</hi> to prevail with <hi>Philemon</hi> to yeeld unto his advice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By preferring them (if in all other regards compariſon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118717:23"/> be equall) in diſcoveries of love and eſtimation. As it was agreed upon betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and the Diſciples, that he ſhould <hi>rather lodge at the houſe of Mnaſon an old Diſciple,</hi> then any<note place="margin">Acts 21. 16.</note> where elſe. By thus doing, we ſhall witneſſe to the world that our judgements are rectified, and our converſations are ordered by the word of truth, and that therefore we account the <hi>hoary-head to be a Crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having concluded my diſcourſe upon the Text, I know it is expected, that I ſhould ſpeak unto the occaſion of our meeting concerning this Reverend Father (whoſe Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral we now celebrate) I will premiſe this, that a full Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of his long well-ſpent Life, cannot be expected from my report at this time, but I hope that it will in due time be drawn up and handed unto you for his honourable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and for imitation unto poſterity, by One who was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acquainted both with his Life and Death.</p>
            <p>In generall this I dare aſſert with confidence (wherein I doubt not your conſent) that his <hi>hoary head was a Crown of glory, for it was found in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi> Through Gods good providence, he had a long time worn this his Crown, for he was well nigh Fourſcore years old. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this his great age, yet (through unuſuall divine indulgence) his <hi>ſtrength was not labour and ſorrow,</hi> for he<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. 10.</note> was neither afflicted with the Stone, or Gowt, or Cramp, or any Cough; but he laboured only (as I have often heard him ſay) under the diſeaſe of weak old age. That which is recorded of <hi>Abraham,</hi> may be applied to him, <hi>That he died in a</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 8.</note> 
               <hi>good old age, an old man and full of years.</hi> Neither were the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of his minde abated, but his underſtanding and memory continued ſtrong, even unto his end. As all his Works publiſhed, do proclaim his incomparable learning in all kindes: ſo thoſe which were lately printed do witneſſe that Academicall ſtudies (when he was young) were freſh and ready for improvement in his old age. And the promiſe made to the righteous man, was verified in him, <hi>He ſhall bring forth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 92. 14.</note> 
               <hi>fruit in old age, he ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</hi> In all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118717:23"/> whether we conſider the continued healthfull frame of his body, or the uninterrupted fruitfullneſſe of the gifts and graces of his ſpirit, it may be truly ſaid of him, in reference to his death. <hi>That he is come to his grave in a full age, like as a</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5. 26.</note> 
               <hi>ſhock of Corn cometh in in his ſeaſon.</hi> But that I may not antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the intended Narrative of his whole Life, I ſhall only declare two or three paſſages towards the end of his dayes. When he looked upon the weakning diſtempers (which had cauſed him to keep his bed) as the Arreſt of death, he was pleaſed (through his love to my worthleſſe ſelf) to give order that I ſhould be certified of his weakneſſe, that he might be remembred before the Lord in my prayers; and alſo that I might be requeſted, as from himſelf, to perform the like office of reſpect for him, which I had lately done for his Reverend neighbour M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Whitaker,</hi> by preaching his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Sermon. Upon this intelligence the next morning I haſtened unto him, to witneſſe mine unfeigned love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reſpect of him, as alſo to put this work (which I have now performed) with his approbation, upon an abler hand: but finding him altogether unwilling to excuſe me, I thought it more meet to undertake it, then to diſtemper his ſpirit by my refuſall. By reaſon of his very great weakneſſe he could not ſpeak much, but that which he ſaid was weighty and ſavoury, which I will faithfully relate: His words were theſe; <hi>I am now conflicting with my laſt Adverſary, though I beleeve the ſting is taken out. Nature will ſtruggle, but I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmit unto the good pleaſure of God. I heartily beg the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of my many ſinnes, eſpecially of my want of ſedulity and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in my publick and private charge, hoping to be waſhed with Chriſts blood, and deſiring to be tranſlated out of this reſtleſſe condition. I expect daily, yea hourly to be tranſlated into that everlaſting reſt, which God hath prepared for them who are intereſted in his Chriſt: And I pray God to bleſſe you, and his whole Miniſtery every where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were his laſt words unto me, upon which I might much enlarge my ſelf; but I leave the improvement hereof, and of his laborious exemplary Life, unto your conſcientious
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118717:24"/> endeavours. Although he be now dead, yet he ſtill liveth by his worthy Works already printed, unto which I hope many more (which be left ready for the Preſſe) will be added for future profit in the Church of Chriſt. I conclude, with hearty deſires, that this ſad providence, in his death, may be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto us all, and eſpecially unto his neareſt Relations, through Gods rich grace in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. he counted all outward advantages as nothing in compariſon of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus. Therefore his Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his unchangeable ſtedfaſtneſſe in that choice (which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118717:25"/> had nothing to prejudice it but the ſeeming novelty,) recalled him, and with great diſpleaſure revoked his own Grant, which yet could not take effect without the Sonnes conſent. But the young diſciple had already learned the hard leſſon of ſelf-denyall and forſaking all to follow Chriſt. Therefore to preſerve his conſcience, he gave up that which had been the bait of Apoſtaſie. Now the Lord (that hath promiſed to his faithfull followers ſatisfaction for all their loſſes) raiſed him up Friends, by whoſe means and advice he purſued his ſtudies at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and in proceſs of time, (when not only the clowds of ignorance and ſuperſtition were diſpelled, but alſo the ſhowers of blood were blown over) he took upon him the publick Miniſtry of the Goſpel. He was houſhold Chaplain to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and Paſtor of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Edmunds</hi> in <hi>Lumbertſtreet</hi> London. In that Parſonage-houſe by his Wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> being of an honeſt Family of the <hi>Pigots</hi> in <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> (among other Children) he had this Sonne <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> born <hi>Sept 4. A. D</hi> 1574.</p>
            <p>In his Childhood he was ſo addicted to thoſe means which his Parents applied him unto, for the implanting in him the ſeeds of good literature, that he needed a bridle rather then a ſpur; for his love of Learning (equall to that admirable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity wherewith the Father of Lights had furniſhed him) was ſo active in the acquiring of it, that his Father hath often gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chidden him from his book. Neither were his nimble wit,<note place="margin">

               </note> ſharp reaſon, and vaſt memory perverted to be the inſtruments of that debauchery wherewith the corruption of our nature doth too often ſtain and deflower our firſt dayes: for he had a lovely gravity in his young converſation; ſo that, what <hi>Greg.

            </p>
            <p>Having happily diſpatched his <hi>tyrocinnia</hi> of firſt exerciſes in the Grammer-Schools (wherein he overcame by ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry the difficulties which that age, deſtitute of many helps our preſent dayes enjoy, conflicted withall; and outſtripped many that ran in the ſame courſe,) before he had compleated
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118717:25"/> ſixteen years. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1590. He was by his Father placed in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Not long after his ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, his Father (being called by God to receive the reward of his labours) left him not wholly deſtitute, yet not ſufficiently provided for any long continuance of his ſtudies there. But God that hath engaged his truth and mercy to the upright, even for their ſeed alſo (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 1, 2.) (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Sonne doth not degenerate or thwart the providence of God, by a forfeiture of his title to the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,) provided friends and means for him, who was by an hidden counſel then deſigned to be an inſtrument of doing ſervice to the Church of Chriſt. Thus the fruit was not nipped in a promiſing bud, by the froſt of want.</p>
            <p>Now, not from meer favour, but from merit (upon the proof of his Learning) he was choſen Scholer of that worthy Society, wherein he continued his Studies with unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and happy ſucceſs, till he with Abilities anſwerable to his Degree, commenced Maſter of Arts. Take for an inſtance of his Induſtry this (<hi>viz.</hi> that he was a conſtant Auditor of that eminent Light of Learning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jo. Boys,</hi> who read a Greek Lecture in his bed to certain young Students that preferred <hi>antelucana ſtudia</hi> before their reſt and eaſe. The Notes of thoſe praelections he kept as a treaſure, and being viſited by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Boys</hi> many years after, he produced them, to the no ſmall joy of the good old man, who profeſſed himſelf made ſome years younger by that entertainment.</p>
            <p>Then was contracted that ſtreight friendſhip betwixt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gataker</hi> and that faithfull ſervant of Chriſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Rich. Stock,</hi> which continued untill the death of this Reverend Miniſter, as appears by the teſtimony given unto him at his Funeral.</p>
            <p>An evidence of the good eſteem which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gataker</hi> had now acquired for his Learning and Piety was this, that a College be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then to be erected by the munificence of the Counteſs of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> the Truſtees of that Foundreſs (Perſons eminent for Zeal and Prudence,) did chooſe him to be one of that Society. They tranſplanted him into that new Nurſery of Arts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, being confident that he would (as he did by Chriſts aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118717:26"/> prove fruitfull for the ornament and benefit of that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary. Indeed they laid hold of him before the houſe was fit for inhabitants, fearing leſt ſo fair and promiſing a flower ſhould be taken up by ſome other hand. But while the College was in building (that he might not loſe any opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good,) he retired to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Aylofes</hi> houſe in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who had gained him that he might inſtruct both himſelf in the Hebrew Tongue, and his eldeſt Sonne in Literature proper to his age. In this Family, partly by his own inclination, and partly by the incouragement of the Governours thereof, he performed holy Duties for the inſtruction of the whole houſhold, expounding a portion of Scripture every morning, that the Sunne of Righteouſneſs might as conſtantly ariſe, as the day brake in upon them. In this Exerciſe, whereby he laboured <hi>&amp; proficere &amp; prodeſſe</hi> (both to edifie others and himſelf) he diſpatched the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and a good part of the book of <hi>Job,</hi> rendring the Text out of the Original Languages, and thence delivering cleer explications,, and alſo deducing uſefull obſervations. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Stern</hi> then Suffragan of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> (viſiting the Miſtreſs of the Family, to whom he was neerly related,) happened to be preſent at this Exerciſe, when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gataker</hi> explicated the firſt Chapter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which is known to be moſt pregnant of deep divine myſteries. This portion of holy Writ he treated upon with ſo happy elucidations, that the judicious Doctor much ſatisfied with the performance, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the indowments of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gataker,</hi> exhorted him inſtantly to take holy Orders, whereby thoſe Gifts might be authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for publick uſe, and improved for the building up of the Church, and withall offered him his aſſiſtance in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But he well weighing the burden of that Calling, and modeſtly judging of his own ability, which he conceived diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable to that Office (to the full diſcharge whereof the Apoſtle hath ſet, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; who is ſufficient?) thanked the Doctor for his kind offer, but deferred the matter to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confideration. Afterward by the advice of the Reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hen. Alvey,</hi> formerly his Tutor, and in this buſineſs taken
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118717:26"/> for a Counſellor, upon his remonſtrance of divers reaſons, and the inſtances of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Stern</hi> afreſh reiterated, he aſſented to be Ordained by the ſaid Suffragan.</p>
            <p>The Fabrick of <hi>Sidney-Suſſex</hi>-Colledge being now conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, he betook himſelf to the ſtation deſigned him, and to the work depending thereon, wherein his pains for ſeaſoning young Students with principles of piety and learning were both great and proſperous; for ſome of them that watered their gardens at his Spring, or lighted their Lamps at his Light, grew up to eminency, as M. <hi>Jo. Hoyl</hi> and M. <hi>Tho. Pell</hi> afterwards worthy Fellows of the ſame Society.</p>
            <p>About that time certain perſons zealous of promoting the glory of God and gaining ſouls to Chriſt, that lay in a ſad condition through the defect of Paſtors able to teach and leade the people in the waies of truth, life, and peace, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially M. <hi>Abdias Aſhton</hi> of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Johns,</hi> and M. <hi>William Bedel</hi> of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> ſet on foot a deſign of preaching in places adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the Univerſity even to a conſiderable diſtance; Theſe invited M. <hi>Gataker</hi> to be a partner in this labour; Being drawn in and encouraged by them, he preached every Lords day at <hi>Everton</hi> (a village in the meeting-confines of <hi>Cambridge, Bedford,</hi> and <hi>Huntingtonſhire</hi>) where a decrepid man (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be 30. years above an 100.) ſuſtained the Name of Vicar, <hi>Vix magni nominis umbra.</hi> Here a Family of <hi>Burgoins</hi> reſident in that place deſerveth this Honourable remembrance, that M. <hi>Roger Burgoin</hi> during that time uſed M. <hi>Gataker</hi> with great humanity, which by him was conſtrued to be the effect of his piety.</p>
            <p>After half a year thus religiouſly employed with manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a publike ſpirit, finding ſome cauſes to retire from the Univerſity, at the motion of M. <hi>Aſhton</hi> above-mentioned (that had been Tutor) he removed to Sir <hi>William Cooks</hi> Family then reſident in <hi>London.</hi> This place and employment occaſioned the more publike diſcovery of his Miniſterial gifts, with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular approbation of many perſons of note, not only for outward eſtate, but alſo for affection unto, and judgement in Religion: Hereupon the Lecturers place at <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inne
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118717:27"/> falling void, ſome principall perſons of that Honourable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (which had been his Auditors occaſionally) made ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes unto him, inviting him to that place, offering their aſſiſtances, and alledging the facility of his Introduction by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pophams</hi> intereſſing himſelf in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, whom they knew both to have loved the Father <hi>Thomas Gataker</hi> (being his intimate once, and contemporary in the ſtudies of Law) and to favour the Son very highly for his own worth and work in the Miniſtry. But he according to his uſuall modeſty declined the undertaking, and reſiſted the importunities even of his Friend M. <hi>Stock,</hi> till D. <hi>Mountague</hi> Maſter of <hi>Sydney</hi>-Colledge, repairing to <hi>London,</hi> and being acquainted with the deſign in hand (though he had it in his thoughts to invite M. <hi>Gatacre</hi> back to the Colledge, that he might reade an Hebrew Lecture that had a Salary annexed by the Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> yet (laying that aſide) preſt M. <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> with Arguments and Authority, encouraged him againſt his own diffidence, and wrought him at laſt to an aſſent that without any ſuit made by him the Lord <hi>Popham</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to that ſociety. Thus was he choſen Preacher at <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inne, where he ſpent ten years to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of piety, and with a happy Reformation of ſome abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Lords day, as he himſelf teſtifies in his Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſcourſe againſt <hi>Lilly, pag.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding that Engagement M. <hi>Gataker</hi> did not totally abandon the Family of Sir <hi>William Cook,</hi> to whoſe Lady he was neer by bloud, and dear to both, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his pious labours amongſt them. Therefore in the vacations being diſengaged from attendance at the Inne of Court, he reſided in that Family, exerciſing his Miniſtry ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thier Chappell or in the Pariſh-Church, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and this with an Apoſtolicall minde, not for filthy lucre, but freely making the Goſpel a burthen only to the diſpenſer: Yet ſuch was the devotion of that religious pair, that they alſo would not ſerve God without coſt, for they afterwards in conſideration of thoſe pains freely taken ſetled upon M. <hi>Gataker</hi> an Annuity of 20<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> 
               <hi>per annum,</hi> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118717:27"/> received for ſome few years, but after (for certain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) remitted unto the Heir of that Family, forbearing to uſe the Right he had, and forbidding his Executor to claim any Arrears of that Annuity. This is mentiooed the rather that the generous temper of his Chriſtian Soul aiming at the higheſt good of others more then his own temporall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and infinitely removed from ſordid acquiſition of gain, or the proſtitution of his ſacred Function unto ſecular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, may be oppoſed to ſtop the impudent clamour of ſome whoſe conſciences being both galled and cauterized, prompted them to calumniate him as guilty of covetouſneſſe. But his own pen writ the beſt Apology, as indeed (according to that of <hi>Nazianzen</hi>) they that give him a juſt character and due<note place="margin">Greg. Epita. Baſil.</note> commendation, had need to have alſo his Eloquence.</p>
            <p>While he attended on that Flock at <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Sidley</hi> a Learned <hi>Mecaenas</hi> and pious Patron of the Church offered him a fair Benefice, and becauſe M. <hi>Gataker</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the burthen of a Paſtoral Cure, and pleaded an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to be taken off from thoſe worthy Gentlemen (of whoſe favour he had good experience) he endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that the taking of an aſſiſtant would ſalve all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, ſo that he needed not to deſert the Society which in Term-time only, required his labours. But he that poiſed that burthen in the Scale of the Sanctuary, alwaies thought that one Cure of ſouls was enough for one man, and adventured the unkinde reſentment of the Noble Gentleman upon the refuſall, rather then the accumulation of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>After ten years labours profitably employed at <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> not only for the benefit of the then living Servants of God, but alſo for the behoof of poſterity, eſpecially by that Learned Diſcouſe of <hi>Lots</hi> there and then conceived, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (wherein what ſatisfaction is given to conſcience in many caſes, let the judicious acknowledge) M. <hi>Gataker</hi> thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to undertake the Rectory of <hi>Rotherhith</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> of the grounds, motive, and manner whereof he himſelf hath largely given an account to the world in his Apologetick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <hi>Lilly,</hi> p. 44. 48. of which this is the Summe.</p>
            <p>The Rectory of <hi>Redrith</hi> in <hi>Surry</hi> (as it is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) being void, and one of an infamous life labouring hard to ſucceed in it (in order to which he before the Incumbents death had ſet on foot a tranſaction with the mother of certain Orphans in whoſe hands the Patronage was ſuppoſed to reſt,) ſome of the Religious Inhabitants valuing the means of grace above all other enjoyments, caſt their eyes and thoughts upon M. <hi>Gataker,</hi> to gain whom they added to their own entreaties the mediation of his good Friend M. <hi>Richard Stock.</hi> And when he had by many reaſons remonſtrated unto him, that God did call him to the work, whoſe honour and Ordinances might ſuffer prejudice by the intruſion of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy man, he at laſt ſuffered himſelf to be perſwaded to engage himſelf in that charge, which being repreſented to Sir <hi>Henry Hobart</hi> then Attorney-Generall by M. <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> (afterward Lord Chief Juſtice.) Sir <hi>Henry</hi> that before favoured other pretenſions to gratifie ſome Tenants of his in the Pariſh, did yet readily embrace the motion concerning ſetling of M. <hi>Gataker</hi> there, according to his contentment, and wrote a Letter to the Biſhop for the removall of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that lay in the way or might hinder the acceptance of the Preſentation of M. <hi>Gataker,</hi> which ſigned with the hands of all the three Brethren who had Right in that Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, was tendred on his behalf.</p>
            <p>The report of his remove was no welcome news to many of that ſociety, who fain would retain him, ſome whereof offered an enlargement of his maintenance for an argument to keep him, and others repreſented the conſiſtence of both employments by the help of an Aſſiſtant. But he that made not his Miniſtery <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

Therefore <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1611. commending his former charge to the grace of God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to the ſole attendance on that Flock of which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118717:28"/> God had now made him overſeer. His induſtry in diſcharge thereof was conſtant and great, notwithſtanding an almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall headach, wherewith God had exerciſed him from his very youth, and for which he had this only poor comfort from his Phyſicians, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

To the work of his Miniſtry in publick upon the Sabbath, he added a weekly Catecheticall Lecture on Friday in the evening, deſigned by him to lay the foundation of ſaving knowledge in the hearts of Children, a certain number whereof every Lecture day did give an account of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by ſet Anſwers to Queſtions delivered out unto them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand for their inſtruction. (<hi>This courſe of holding a ſound form of words, agreeable to the doctrine of the Goſpel conſigned in holy writ, of what importance it is, we may conclude from that ignorance and error that have invaded the Church of later times, theſe miſchiefs being imputable ſcarce to any thing ſo much as to the omiſſion of that uſefull duty of Catechiſing.</hi>) But that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe was performed by him, with ſuch an accurate and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call explication of the whole body of Divinity, that Chriſtians of riper years and long ſtanding in Chriſts School, did reſort to be partakers of thoſe diſcourſes, wherein their well exerciſed ſenſes found not only milk fit for Children, but alſo ſolid meat ſuitable to grown men in Chriſt.

               <hi>Gatakers</hi> conſtant retirement in his ſtudy, made the choice of a help meet for him, that might overſee his Family, a neceſſary act of prudence. Therefore not long before he left <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> he married the Widdow of M. <hi>William Cupper,</hi> to whoſe two Daughters he was ſo providently kind in their education
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118717:29"/> and diſpoſing in marriage to two Divines of note, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſuch a fatherly love to them and theirs, that the world miſtook them for his own children. That Wife died in childbed of a Sonne, that bore the Fathers Name, who after that he had ſeen the moſt remote parts of the world wherewith we keep commerce, returned home to his Father and died in peace.</p>
            <p>The ſame motive ſtill being in force, he after a decent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of widdowhood, choſe to himſelf the Daughter of a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divine M. <hi>Charles Pinner,</hi> who was then brought up in the worthy and religious Family of M. <hi>Ellis Criſp,</hi> Brother to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>Pinner.</hi> It pleaſed God to give him a Sonne by her (who in proceſs of time was dedicated to Gods work in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery) but immediately to take away the Mother, ſo that the Mothers Funerals and Childs Baptiſm were celebrated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thus our wiſe and gracious Father tempers the cup for his Children, leſt they ſhould ſurfet upon earthly enjoyments, as they might eaſily do if they were meer and unmixt with oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>He remained then for many years in a diſconſolate ſolitude, till he again adventured and married a Gentlewoman of a very conſiderable Family, being Siſter to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>George,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>John Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> and of a good eſteem for underſtanding and piety. By her he had three Children, whereof a Sonne and a Daughter were carried to the ground before their Mother, but the third yet lives to walk by the light of her Fathers life and doctrine. This Gentlewoman being of a contemplative minde fell into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, which waſted the body ſo that the ſoul took flight from thence to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all he took to Wife a Citizens Widow, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable converſation he enjoyed twenty four years, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue by her. The love to her was one motive, why he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated out of his Parſonage-houſe to another habitation of his own revenue; for ſuppoſing that ſhe might be the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, he would make a convenient proviſion for her that ſhe might not be ſubject to anothers curteſie for removal. And that affection extended it ſelf in great liberality to divers of her kinred that were capable of ſupport from him, both in her
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118717:29"/> life time and ſince her deceaſe. Her he ſurvived two years within a few dayes, and becauſe he numbred his dayes with wiſedom, preſuming that the time was approaching of his ſoul being maried to the Lamb, he could not endure to liſten unto the motion of ſome that adviſed him to a new entanglement in the world.</p>

               <hi>Hughs</hi> (his <hi>Mnaſon,</hi> whoſe houſe he uſed frequently in <hi>London</hi>) he took his voyage, taking withall a Nephew of his being a young Student to be a partaker of that travell. His Mother then alive had ſome fears, leſt he being a known adverſary to the Popiſh cauſe (which he had mortally wounded with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious weapons) ſhould ſuffer inconvenience from that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vipers, whoſe virulent malice often prompts them to baſe courſes of ſecret revenge. But God was his guide and his ſhield, and proſpered his journey ſo, that within a moneth (for they took boat <hi>July</hi> 13. and returned ſafe <hi>Aug.</hi> 14.) he had viewed the moſt conſiderable places in the Low Countries. In this travell he gave better ſatisfaction to the Engliſh Church at <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> where he gave way to the importunity of friends, deſiring to hear him as well as glad to ſee him, then he did to the Engliſh Papiſts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with whom he had divers debates, wherein he drove ſome to a confuſion whom he could not gain to converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. a violent fit of the Colick aſſaulted him, and brought him to the very brink of the grave: but God brought him back again that he might do him further ſervice. For the year enſuing, before he had well recovered his ſtrength, he was called by the Parliament to ſit as one of that Aſſembly, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118717:30"/> was ſummoned to be conſulted about Religion; where his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for promoting Truth and ſuppreſſing Error were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and ſerious: And his ſtudy of Peace with modeſty was in this remarkable, that when his Reafons delivered concerning Chriſts obedience in order to our Juſtification (wherein he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from his brethren) could not obtain aſſent from the major part which determined the Queſtion contrary to his ſenſe, his own love of unity impoſed upon him ſilence; and wrought him likewiſe unto reſolutions, not to publiſh his diſcourſes of that ſubject from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28. that he might not publikely diſeover his diſſent from the Votes of that Reverend Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>During his attendance upon the work of that Convention, the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> (being acquainted with his great worth and fitneſs in regard of his Learning in all kindes, for Academicall tranſactions) offered him the Maſterſhip of <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> College in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> which is the greateſt preferment of that Univerſity: for that Noble Lord being intruſted by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, with the care of that Academy, was not paſſionately tranſported with a blind partiality of mens perſons, upon any ſiniſter reſpects, but deſired to prefer them, whom he judged moſt worthy and moſt hopefull to do Chriſt ſervice there: and therefore being perſwaded that M. <hi>Gataker</hi> might (both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his gravity and vaſt Scholaſticall abilities) be a choice ornament of that Univerſity, and a fair Copy for others to write by, he was very deſirous to place him there. But this good man (though often importuned by many friends, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the motion) according to his accuſtomed modeſty, with many thanks unto the Earl, refuſed to undertake that place of much honour, ſervice, and outward advantage, pleading toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his unworthineſs, the weakneſs of his body by reaſon of age, and thereupon his inability to take journies. And becauſe he looked upon himſelf as having one foot in the grave, he humbly deſired, that a younger man might be thought upon, more likely to be long ſerviceable then himſelf, in that place of great eminency and truſt. And indeed the ſenſe of his own weakneſs was not a vain preſage of his decayes, for not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was again ſurprized with the Colick, which before had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118717:30"/> ſhaken him and made his crazy body leſs able to endure new conflicts: and theſe were ſo ſharp, that his reſtauration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared deſperate, not only to his other friends, but alſo to his Phyſitians. Yet it pleaſed God <hi>chaſtening him ſore, not to give</hi>

            <p>But after a long time of being priſoner to his own home, he by Gods aſſiſtance recovered ſo much ſtrength as to go to Gods houſe. And now he beleeved himſelf bound to employ his Miniſteriall gifts in Gods ſervice: Therefore he again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured into the Pulpit, where he ſpent himſelf ſo farre, that he ſtreyned a vein in his lungs, for which being then about Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty three years old, he ſuffered an emiſſion of blood, by which and other means God enabled him to overpaſs that danger. But when he had recruited his veins and ſinews with freſh ability, he unwilling to fall under the <hi>wo for not preaching,</hi> acted more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> to the willingneſs of the ſpirit then proportionably to the weakneſs of his fleſh, till a relapſe into that ſpitting of blood (for which he again permitted a vein to be opened for revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,) laid on him the neceſſity of forbearing the Pulpit. But he never gave over the adminiſtration of Sacraments, nor his uſuall ſhort diſcourſes at Funerals ſuitable to the occaſion (whenſoever he was ſolicited unto them,) though thoſe ſhorter exerciſes of his Lungs were painfull and waſtfull of that oyl, which like a burning light he ſpent for enlightning others. The main of his time now was ſpent in ſtudy, and that deſigned not to a meer entertainment of himſelf in a quiet privacy, but to the publick benefit of the preſent Church and poſterity, as, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Works, thoſe exquiſite Annotations on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and of <hi>Jeremy</hi> with his <hi>Lamentations,</hi> do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118717:31"/> teſtifie. And we ſhould have gained more by his lateſt induſtry, if the malitious ſlanders of the enemies to the truth had not diverted his ſtudies to ſome neceſſary Apologies. Neither did he, being diſenabled to preach, deſert his flock, or betray it into the power of Wolves, that would make a prey of precious ſouls: For troubled at the apprehenſion of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that the foundation which he had laid (after the example of the wiſe maſter-builder S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>) might either not be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ript up, he retained the Title of Rector with a charge beyond the Revenue (as it was ſometime paid,) till proviſion was made of a faithfull and orthodox Miniſter to whom he might devolve both burden and benefit.</p>
            <p>To his care of feeding his flock in publick, very agreeable was his diligence to inſtruct his family in private: for on Friday night weekly he did expound after ſupper that ſhort Catechiſm which he had publiſhed for the uſe of his Pariſhioners; in which courſe he ſo laid forth the Nature and Attributes of God, the conditions of man intire and corrupt, the means of his fall and recovery, the nature of Faith and Repentance, with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacraments, that his Parlour was one of the beſt ſchools for a young ſtudent to learn Divinity. And indeed his houſe was a private ſemminary for divers young Gentlemen of this Nation, and more forreigners did reſort to him and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ with him, to receive from him advice and advancement in their ſtudies: And many that afterwards were eminent in the Churches both here and abroad, were brought up under his eye at leaſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet.</p>
            <p>Perſons of note that had been his Aſſiſtants;</p>

Mr. <hi>Grayle,</hi> and others yet living labourers in Gods vineyard.</p>
            <p>Of foreigners that ſojourned with him, and were as ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of being entertained by him, as of being admitted to an Academy, theſe were ſome:</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Thyloin,</hi> after a reverend Paſtor of the Dutch Church in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118717:31"/> 
               <hi>London,</hi> (whoſe Sonne was brought by his Mother but a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night afore M. <hi>Gatakers</hi> deceaſe, intreating the ſame good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the behalf of him, which the Father had with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort enjoyed.) M. <hi>Peters,</hi> M. <hi>And. Demetrius,</hi> M. <hi>Hornbeck,</hi> M. <hi>Rich,</hi> M. <hi>Swerd,</hi> M. <hi>Wittefrungel,</hi> M. <hi>Severinus Benzon,</hi> M. <hi>George De Mey,</hi> D. <hi>Treſchovius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtrength of his Memory was extraordinary, as may appear by this demonſtration (<hi>viz.</hi>) That though he uſed no Common-place book; yet he had in readineſs whatſoever he had read, as his manifold quotations do manifeſt.</p>
            <p>His gifts for Edification may be conjectured by his Works extant, in which he hath ſhewed himſelf moſt like the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and induſtrious Bee, for the rare extraction of all manner of knowledge from almoſt all Authors, and the ſolid digeſtion of it firſt, and then ſtoring it up for the publike good. His polite literature was admired by the great lights of Learning abroad, as the excellent <hi>Salmaſius</hi> and others, with whom he held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. And the exerciſe of it with condeſcenſion to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hath been enjoyed with wonder and pleaſure at his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Tunbridg</hi> School with the Right Worſhipfull Company of Skinners the worthy Patrons thereof. That, which made all his knowledge both uſefull and gratefull, was, that he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vain in oſtentation, nor moroſe, nor illiberal in reſervation. But beyond all he ſacrificed his Talents to God, while he made <hi>Hagar</hi> ſerve <hi>Sarah,</hi> and contributed the Aegyptian ſpoyls (all his foreign Learning) to the building of the Tabernacle: for with a ſtrange felicity, he made his humane literature, (both his moral and critical ſtudies,) become ſubſervient to Religion, and inſtrumental to the explication of heavenly Truths.</p>
            <p>His graces of Sanctification were very eminent in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to all purpoſes, and toward all relations. In his life, as to his private courſe, moſt remarkable were his Piety, Humility and Charity.</p>
            <p>His Piety appeared, not only by his diligence in preaching, but alſo by his own frequenting Gods Ordinances diſpenſed by others; in order to which he did once at leaſt weekly repair to ſome Lecture in <hi>London,</hi> ſo long as he had liberty to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118717:32"/> the bounds of his own Pariſh. A ſign of that Piety, was his great devotion in obſerving the Lords day, which he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated totally (excepting the ſeaſons of repaſt) unto holy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. And a fruit of it was his free contribution upon divers occaſions to the maintaining of the Lords houſe of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And becauſe there is a connexion of ſacred perſons and things, his love to religious and faithfull Miniſters may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as an act of Piety as well as of Charity.</p>
            <p>An evident inſtance of his zeal for Gods glory, was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant conſideration of Gods Churches abroad, with a diligent inquiry after their eſtate, and a tender ſenſe of their affliction, which begat that meditation on <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. intituled <hi>Sorrow for Sion</hi> His eager deſire of a Reformation of things amiſs amongſt us, was doubtleſs acceptable to God, though this ſinfull nation is yet unworthy to have it ſatisfied. One ſpecial and proper effect of his Piety, I take to be that Holineſs of life expreſt in a conſtant tenour of good duties, with the abridgment of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in things indifferent, eſpecially of recreations (for he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood no recreation beſides ſtudy, and made the <hi>amaener</hi> part of ſtudies, the ſauce to the more <hi>austere</hi>) that he might give no ſcandall to the good, nor encouragement to the bad, citing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thoſe two golden Rules of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul, All things are lawfull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 6. &amp; 10. 23.</note> 
               <hi>but all things are not convenient or expedient;</hi> and, <hi>All things are lawfull, but all things edifie not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Humility was apparent:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that low eſteem he had of his own gifts, which all that knew him admired. He was a true <hi>Moſes,</hi> that took not any notice of the ſhining luſtre of his own countenance: like a fair ear of Corn loaden with grain, he bended his head downward: for he had nothing of the Phariſaicall temper, either to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance himſelf, or to vilifie his meaner-gifted brethren.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his freedom from ambition of outward advantages; for he declined not only large means in the Countrey, but alſo<note place="margin">
                  <hi>

Hunc tantum terris oſtendent fata nec ultra, Eſſe ſinent</hi>—</note> both Eccleſiaſticall dignities, and Courtly preferments. For he ſtudiouſly waved the counſell of ſome that had given notice of him to that hopefull Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (whom God only ſhewed to this Land, and ſnatched away to himſelf,) and had it in deſign
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118717:32"/> to make way for his being admitted Chaplain to his Highneſs. For the ſame reaſon he conſtantly declined publike appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that he could not without much reluctancy, be drawn by thoſe who had intereſt in him unto more ſolemn Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In his meek converſation with the meaneſt Chriſtians, for he refuſed not to treat with the pooreſt Chriſtian that repaired unto him for counſel or ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>His Charity was large, though for the moſt part ſecret, both in giving and forgiving to poor perſons; for he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to blaze, only allowed it to ſhine, when his example was requiſite to lighten and lead others to glorifie God and gratifie men. In redemption of Captives, relief of poor Proteſtants, eſpecially thoſe of the Miniſtry; to the repairs of publick or common loſſes and general calamities, and to the ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of any good work, he was ſtrangely liberall, the fruit whereof the Lord returned into his own boſome, according to his own word, that <hi>the liberal ſhall be made fat.</hi> For he did not ſo exhauſt himſelf in his life, but that in his laſt Will, he did alſo bequeath unto the poor of the Pariſh of <hi>Redrith</hi> 50<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>, to Ten of his Bretheren in the Miniſtery, whoſe wants and diſtreſſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if occaſioned by the iniquity of the times, he did conſider with compaſſion, 50<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>; <hi>i. e.</hi> to each of them 5<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>; and to eight Widows of Miniſters 5<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> apeece, in all 40<hi rend="sup">lb</hi> to them. Thus his good works both went before him, and followed him alſo to Heaven, whereby likewiſe he hath left behind him the luſtre of a good Name, for the imitation of them who ſurvive.</p>
            <p>Juſtice is preſuppoſed to Charity, for <hi>God hates robbery for</hi>

               <hi>Gataker</hi> was exactly juſt in giving every man his due, though he remitted of his own right very frequently, ſo that he was according to the Hebrew phraſe, imitated by the writers of the N. T. a juſt man, that is, a kind, equitable perſon, of a mild diſpoſition; no ſevere exacter of his own, and a free diſpenſer of Gods gifts, ſo that <hi>his Righteouſneſs endures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> both to his honour upon earth, and to his happineſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>In and about his death, to which the courſe of his declining days leads us, eminent were his Patience and Faith, the latter at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118717:33"/> with a deep ſenſe of his own ſinnes, which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged unto God, and to him only was that confeſſion need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for as to men his converſation was, as a Biſhops ought to be, <hi>irreprovable.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt ſtage to his deceaſe (for <hi>morhus eſt via ad mortem</hi>) was a fainting fit that ſurprized him on Friday night <hi>July</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, or rather on Saturday morning <hi>July</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. This he made no great account of (for he diſturbed not the reſt of a ſervant by calling for aſſiſtance) becauſe he had at ſundry times ſuch <hi>deliquia</hi> or faintings, wherein he gave Nature leave to work out her victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over thoſe vapours or viſcous humours that oppreſſed her. Yet thus far he made uſe of it, that he compared his infirmity to that of <hi>Seneca,</hi> which according to his relation, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of that age called <hi>meditationem mortis,</hi> and wiſhed it might prove to him a preparation for his diſſolution. The indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not ceaſing with that fit, diſcovered it ſelf within a ſhort time to be a Tertian, which how gentle ſoever, yet falling upon a perſon of his age and crazy temper (that had long ſupported a weak frame with a very regular courſe of diet) made his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doubtfull to his Phiſician, one of learning and worth, that imployed his beſt care and skill about that Patient, that he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as a conſiderable Perſon to the whole Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 17. Having publiſhed his Will, and taken ſuch order as he thought fit for the ſettlement of his outward eſtate, he compoſed himſelf to God. His Tertian, growing too ſtrong for Nature and Art both, reſolved it ſelf into an almoſt continued Feaver, the extream heat whereof was very painfull: Yet during thoſe conflicts he ſhewed a ſweet calmneſs of minde, a heart weaned from the world, to which he had no affection, though he had a remembrance exactly ſerving for ordering his Charity even to the laſt; and in one word, he repreſented a ſoul wholly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Gods good pleaſure. He profeſt more then once, that no outward thing troubled him ſo much, as the condition of that Reverend Miniſter M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sainthill,</hi> who had but lately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gatakers</hi> Charge, upon the uncertain title of Life, which now failing ſo early, beſides the expectation of his friends, that Miniſter he foreſaw was likely to be unſetled and to ſuffer ſome inconvenience.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:118717:33"/>
            <p>Though friends and Phyſicians give him incouraging words at viſits, yet he ſenſible of his inward decayes, could not be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into vain hopes of long continuance, earneſtly contending that he was not to expect miracles. His expectation of Gods diſmiſſion was ſo fixed, that being conſulted whether he would appoint any one Perſon to perform the laſt office for him; he not ſtartled at the queſtion, appointed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Aſhe</hi> to be intreated to undertake that work, becauſe he had done the ſame at his laſt Wives funerals. And one opportunity caſually offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf to ſet forward that deſign: for <hi>July</hi> 18. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Aſhe</hi> out of a kinde reſpect to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gataker,</hi> ſent him two Funerall Sermons preached by him, one at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Whitakers,</hi> the other at D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows</hi> Childes interment. This gave occaſion to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Gataker</hi> (in the return for that favour) to requeſt the laſt that he could be capable of. Upon the receipt of a Letter to that purpoſe, Mr. <hi>Aſhe</hi> on the Saturday following, viſited his deer and dying friend; who then told him, That <hi>he found him conflicting with his laſt adverſary. He knew the ſting was pulled out, but nature would ſtruggle.</hi> Theſe and other expreſſions M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Aſhe</hi> writ down and related at the end of his Sermon.</p>
            <p>That day being 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> in the afternoon, he called for ſome Papers of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Baxters,</hi> ſent to him by the Author, with a deſire of his judgment concerning them: He wiſhed ſome ſhort Notes (for the peruſal of them had been his laſt work) to be read over to him, in which ſomething he altered; and having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated a Letter to that his Learned and much Reverend Friend, appointed that with the Animadverſions incloſed to be ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: So vigorous was his minde in a body drooping and dropping into the duſt.</p>
            <p>He had now given over the uſe of Phyſick, as to any prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of life, for he ſaid he would ſtruggle no more, becauſe he found, that what was preſcribed for the refreſhing of nature, oppreſt it rather, therefore he would wait the Lords leiſure. An ancient ſervant that attended on him, deſiring leave to rectifie the bedcloathes, and ſaying withall, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Your head doth not lye right; he anſwered, <hi>It will lye right in my Coffin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 25. at One in the morning, death began to ſeize on his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118717:34"/> left foot, from which the ſpirits retiring, he felt the deadneſs of that part, and a very ſharp pain in the part of the leg adjoyning to it. He called for his Sonne, and told him he feared he ſhould have a difficult death. He then commanded two Surgeons to be ſent for to look upon his leg, whom he required to tell him, whether or no his foot were any whit diſcoloured. It ſeems he had conceived ſome fear of a Gangrene, but being ſatisfied that there could not be any ground for ſuch an apprehenſion, he reſted with patience. In the evening of that day, being viſited by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sainthil,</hi> and lying in great anguiſh with violence of heat, he prayed for <hi>pity and patience, ſupport here, and a comfortable iſſue.</hi>

Early in the morning, full of pain, gaſping and pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he cried out, <hi>How long Lord, how long? come ſpeedily.</hi> But though death had made an incroachment upon his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward periſhing part, yet his inward man felt no decay: for with a full uſe of reaſon, he that morning ordered the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a weekly relief to certain poor, and alſo of ſome ſmall monethly Penſions to ſome Widows for a ſeaſon, cauſed his Phyſician to be conſulted about taking ſomething that might procure reſt, was erected to a more cheerfull diſpoſition; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after News, and diſcourſed freely, yet confeſt himſelf to be in pain. About three of the Clock that afternoon, feeling ſome great change after that putting forth of nature, he called for his Siſter, Sonne and Daughter, to receive his laſt charge: Thus he ſpake unto them; <hi>My heart fails, and my ſtrength fails, but God is my fortreſs and the ſtrong rock of my ſalvation: Into thy hands therefore I commend my ſoul; for thou haſt redeemed me oh God of Truth.</hi> To his Sonne he turned his diſcourſe thus; Sonne you have a great charge, look to it, inſtruct your Wife and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the fear of God, and diſcharge your Miniſtry conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly. To his Siſter (a Gentlewoman two years elder then himſelf) he ſaid; Siſter, I thought you might have gone before me, but God calls for me firſt, I hope we ſhall meet in Heaven, I pray God bleſs you. His Daughter he admoniſhed to minde the world leſs and God more, for that all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piety and the true fear of God are worth nothing. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118717:34"/> that his Sonne <hi>Draper</hi> (being a man of means) would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſome godly Miniſter into his houſe, to teach his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and inſtruct his family. He exhorted them all to concord: which he hoped the rather, becauſe he had cleerely ſetled his Eſtate, ſo as to prevent differences. He inlarged himſelf in each a little, wiſhing all to lay to heart the words of a dying man. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he deſired that all ſhould withdraw, and leave him to his reſt, which he hoped was at hand: but all his conflicts were not yet accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 27. His voice began to be leſs intelligible, the putrid preternatural heat having furred up his mouth, as is uſuall in Feavers: yet his underſtanding and ſenſes alſo were very quick and active. About ſix of the Clock in the evening, he called for his Sonne to recommend his ſoul unto God by prayer, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to expreſs what he deſired, but not ſo cleerly as to be well underſtood: yet by his geſtures he gave aſſurance, that he underſtood perfectly, and concurred fervently with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions uſed on his behalf. Within an hour after, nature being quite ſpent, he gave up the Ghoſt, and was tranſlated into that Reſt which he ſo often and earneſtly had deſired to finde in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world, becauſe he could obtain none in this.<note place="margin">Greg.

            <p>Thus after the 43 years inſpection of this pious and diligent Paſtor of <hi>Redrith,</hi> he left his flock, returning to the great and chief Shepheard of our ſouls, from his gracious hands to receive an incorruptible Crown of glory: And of his flock I may take up the words of <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> to <hi>Baſil,</hi> concerning the condition of that Church whereof <hi>Gregories</hi> Father had been Biſhop; <hi>You ſee how full of ſadneſs and trouble this destitute flock appears—making queſtion whether ever it ſhall enjoy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcreet ſhepheard, but very confident it ſhall not receive an equal to their deceaſed Paſter, and reſolved to acquieſce ſatisfied in their lot, if they can obtain one that ſhall be not much worſe.</hi>

            <p>For his Perſon, the expreſs whereof (though often importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by deer friends) he would never allow to be taken either by pencil or ſculpture: He was of a middle ſtature, of a thin body, and of a lively countenance, freſh complexion, that looked
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118717:35"/> young when he came to teach at <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> and yet was grey betimes, that made him be thought elder then he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had long appeared ancient in the eye of the world; of a choicely temperate diet; of a free and cheerfull converſation, addicted to ſtudy, but not ſecluding himſelf from fit company; of a quick apprehenſion, ſharp reaſon, ſolid judgment, vaſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which by Gods mercy continued freſh to the laſt of his days: He was <hi>helluo librorum,</hi> one that did not vainly increaſe his Library for ſhew, but choſe Books for uſe, which he made of them ſo happily, that he had conquered a ſtrange portion of Learning, and made it ſerve him upon all occaſions. He was not ſo great a Treaſurer, as a free diſpencer of thoſe riches of the minde, which he did communicate readily, expeditely, cleerly. He was an ornament of the Univerſity, and of that Society de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ſtudy of Law; a light of the Church, the Salt of the place where he abode: a loving Husband, a diſcreet Parent, a faithfull Friend, a kind Neighbour, a curteous entertainer of ſtrangers, a candid encourager of Students, a ſtout Champion for the Truth, yet a lover of Peace, preſerving the unity of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity where there was a difference of judgement; an adverſary to novel fancies as well as to antiquated ſuperſtitions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: of a Chriſtian magnanimity to deſpiſe the world, and therefore reſolute through bad report as well as good to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a cleer conſcience. Briefly, he was a faithfull Shepheard, and a fit myrror for Paſtors, as well as an exact pattern for people;<note place="margin">

               <l>Whoſe Life by all ſo preciouſly eſteem'd</l>
               <l>I with mine own would gladly have redeem'd:</l>
               <l>And were not Death well undergone to ſave</l>
               <l>So great a Treaſure from the hungry Grave?</l>
               <l>Next unto Him, my Soul doth mourning wear</l>
               <l>For his dear Friend the Famous <hi>Gataker.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Till now the Adage I did ſcarce beleeve,</l>
               <l>Which ſaies, <hi>To fronts we muſt no credence give.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To my great grief too true I finde it now,</l>
               <l>So much deceived by his ſmoother brow;</l>
               <l>Which with the Roſe and Lilly that did deck</l>
               <l>His, and would have becom'd a Ladies cheek,</l>
               <l>Did promiſe fair, and made me hope that He</l>
               <l>Might raiſe eight Decads to a Century.</l>
               <l>Doubtleſſe moſt perfect was the Harmony</l>
               <l>Of's Elements, as was his Symmetry:</l>
               <l>Thus Body and Soul in him were bravely met</l>
               <l>And matcht, but that the one though very neat,</l>
               <l>No large dimenſions had, the other was</l>
               <l>More like an Angel clos'd in ſuch a caſe.</l>
               <l>A neat ſmall manſion this doth entertain</l>
               <l>Sometimes a ſtately Lady with her Train.</l>
               <l>He was (ah killing word, <hi>He was!</hi> alas,</l>
               <l>That now I cannot ſay, <hi>He is,</hi> but was.)</l>
               <l>A Living Star, and that as eminent</l>
               <l>As any ſhin'd i'th Britiſh Firmament.</l>
               <l>But that's too modeſt and anguſt; 'Tis thought</l>

               <l>The crucified three Languages ſpake aloud</l>
               <l>His matchleſſe skill, and ſeemed of Him proud.</l>
               <l>The Arts a better Maſter have not known;</l>
               <l>The Fathers, Councils, Schoolmen, were his own.</l>
               <l>All Neoterick Worthies he did know</l>

               <l>His light did ſhine as freely as the Suns,</l>
               <l>Or as the water from the fountain runs;</l>
               <l>Witneſſe his <hi>Pulpit-pains,</hi> which ne're did ceaſe</l>
               <l>Till Sickneſſe ſerv'd him with a Writ of Eaſe,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Or <hi>Schola Illustris</hi> was, whither did come</l>

               <l>Arm'd with a flaming Sword to guard the way</l>

               <l>And ſacred Truth; which none could ever do</l>

               <l>He knew that Truth moſt Lovely is, and that</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And as his Pen was often militant</l>
               <l>(Nor leſs triumphant,) ſo edificant</l>
               <l>It alſo was; like thoſe bleſt Builders, who</l>

               <l>What Pious, Pretious Peeces have there come</l>
               <l>(All trimmd with richeſt Fringe) out of his Loome!</l>
               <l>But above all his Notes on the firſt paire</l>
               <l>Of Major Prophets juſtly valued are,</l>
               <l>As the moſt golden Key that ere was made</l>
